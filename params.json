Moggle Math** [Header only] - Provides matrix and vector types, and everything that's related. Does not depend on OpenGL or on another part of Moggle, so can be used separately.\r\n\r\n**2. Moggle Core** [Header only] - A very thin wrapper around OpenGL. Provides classes such as 'vbo', 'vao' and 'shader'.\r\n\r\n**3. Moggle XXX** - A very sexy and easy way to use OpenGL.\r\n   It has advanced features such as shader pipelines and more.\r\n\r\nThis page will some day contain links to documentation for these three libraries.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
